# Setup

## IDE Recommendation

Install PyCharm (Community Edition should be ok)
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

Import the project from THIS folder (flask)

## Create Virtual Environment

### 1. Python Required Version: 3.9

We have a dependency on a library called "easyorc", and it requires python 3.9 or lower.

#### We recommended to install Anaconda

This will allow us to control versions of python more easily
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

### 2. Restart your computer

### 3. Create the environment

```
# Change to this directory
cd flask

# Pointing to the correct version of python: Create virtual environment
conda create -n py39 python=3.9.16

# type 'y', to accept the prompt
```

### 4. Activate Virtual Environment

```
conda activate py39
```

Note, if you get "cannot be loaded because its operation is blocked by software restriction       
policies, such as those created by using Group Policy."

Then run ```Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process``` and try again

### 5. Setup IDE to use conda environment

## Install Software Dependencies 

### Install python libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

## Run Tests

To run all tests
```
pytest app/tests/
```

To run just one test class
```
pytest app/tests/tour/tour_update_test.py
```

## Run Server

```
python run.py
```

To run integration tests. This will populate test data.
```
pytest app/integration_tests
```

Navigate to `/apidocs/` to access the documentation.

## Troubleshooting the environment

If you are having trouble with the environment, here is how to wipe everything in Anaconda and start over
```
git pull
conda deactivate py39
conda remove env -n py39 --all
conda install --revision 0
conda create -n py39 python=3.9.16
conda activate py39
pip install -r .\requirements.txt --no-cache-dir --user --force-reinstall
```
